            <p>Change in diet has shown to be beneficial for CD patients, whether it is to reduce symptoms or to stay in remission. Carbohydrates (mainly refined and processed carbohydrates) and proteins (especially animal proteins) are seen to be a risk factor for IBD. A specific carbohydrate diet has shown to be beneficial for CD patients. As one diet can improve a patient's life and reduce their symptoms, another diet does not necessarily have the same effect. This shows that, similar to the use of medication, what works for one patient does not always have to work for another patient. It is therefore important to find something that works best for you by trying out different diets, for example.</p>

            <h1>low-FODMAP diet</h1> 
            <p>The low Fermentable Oligosaccharide, Disaccharide, Monosaccharide and Polyol diet
                (FODMAPs) can especially be used by patients who are in remission and/or are experiencing IBS-like symptoms (e.g. diarrhea and bloating). FODMAPs include fructose, lactose, fructo- and galacto-oligosaccharides and polyols. Foods that are high in FODMAPs are the following:</p>
                <ul class="cam">
                    <li>Fructans: garlic, onion, wheat</li>
                    <li>Fructose: fruits and honey</li>
                    <li>Lactose: dairy products</li>
                    <li>Oligosaccharides: nuts and seeds</li>
                    <li>Polyols: vegetables and fruits</li>
                </ul>
            <p>This diet focuses on eliminating foods that are high in FODMAPs and these products are then reintroduced to examine if a patient reacts to it or not, and therefore should or should not keep these products in their diet. The use of a low-FODMAP diet has shown to be beneficial and it improved the patients quality of life.

        <div class="tekstblok">
            <h1>Semi-vegetarian diet</h1>
            <p>An increased risk of IBD can be due to a westernized diet. The Western diet consists of a lot of refined sugars and fast foods, many foods are processed and there is a lack of fruit and vegetables in this diet pattern. Following a semi-vegetarian diet has shown to prevent a relapse of CD. Patients who follow this diet eat for example eggs, yoghurt, fruit, vegetables, brown rice and potatoes on a daily basis, fish once a week and meat once every two weeks. This is different from the low-FODMAP diet and therefore shows that each patient is unique and responds differently to specific foods.</p>

            <h1>Vitamin D</h1>
            <p>In addition to the fact that diet can play an important role in the treatment of CD, solving a vitamin D deficiency can also make a positive contribution. Adding a vitamin D supplementation is, especially compared to the use of medication, not expensive and it is safe to use. Low vitamin D levels are even associated with patients experiencing more pain and having a lower quality of life. Adding vitamin D supplementation could therefore help in the treatment of CD.</p>

            <h3>Affiliate professor at Wageningen University, Division of Human Nutrition.<br> Gastroenterologist and Hepatologist at Gelderse Vallei Hospital, Ede.</h3>
            <p> <span class="dikgedrukt">Why is there little to nothing in the protocols for Crohn's disease about nutrition or a suitable diet?<br></span> 
                It is scientifically difficult to prove that a diet helps. Nutritional research is very difficult, because it is not a drug research. I am convinced that nutrition helps, because in my experience patients who are well involved with nutrition also feel better, especially the quality of life of patients gets better.
            </p>
            <p><span class="dikgedrukt">Can (prolonged) use of incorrect nutrition cause someone to develop a condition (more quickly), in this case Crohn's disease? <br></span> 
                People who have eaten a lot of sugars are more likely to develop Crohn's disease, but of course you have to have a genetic predisposition for it.
            </p>
            <p><span class="dikgedrukt">Why is fiber so important? And are there people who do not respond well to it, if so why?<br></span> 
                Fiber has a positive effect on the microbiome. A high fiber diet is therefore recommended for IBD patients. You do get more gas from fiber, so it is wise to build up the amount of fiber over a number of weeks. You will always get an increase in complaints, but above all, persevere, because after that it will decrease.
                <br>
                An intestine will only hurt if it expands too much, because an intestine is insensitive on the inside. So just fart!
            </p>
            <p><span class="dikgedrukt">What is the percentage of patients who make use of a modified diet? <br></span> 
                63%
            </p>
            <p><span class="dikgedrukt">What is the percentage of patients who notice a positive effect after changing their diet? <br></span> 
                Approximately 50%
